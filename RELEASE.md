# Release process

This repository publishes one package, `react-native-reserved-regions`. The
example and documentation site are private. Keep this document aligned with
[the Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml).

## One-time trusted-publisher setup

The package already exists on npm. In its npm settings, configure GitHub Actions:

| Field             | Value                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Organization      | `appandflow`                         |
| Repository        | `react-native-reserved-regions`      |
| Workflow filename | `release.yml`                        |
| Environment       | `release`                            |
| Allowed action    | Direct publishing with `npm publish` |

The workflow needs `id-token: write` and a GitHub-hosted runner. Node 24 supplies
a compatible npm CLI (trusted publishing requires npm 11.5.1 or newer). No npm
write token is stored in GitHub. See [npm's trusted publishing guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/).

Create the GitHub `release` environment, require a maintainer review, and restrict
its deployment branches/tags to release tags (`v*`). Verify these settings in
GitHub; declaring `environment: release` in YAML does not create review rules.
The npm trust relationship is also configured separately from the repository.

## Prepare a candidate

Start from reviewed, up-to-date `main`. Check the registry rather than assuming
that a local tag was published:

```sh
git fetch origin --tags
npm view react-native-reserved-regions dist-tags --json
npm view react-native-reserved-regions versions --json
```

Choose the next semver version. Use `X.Y.Z-alpha.N` or `X.Y.Z-rc.N` for prereleases.
All prereleases publish to `next`; stable versions publish to `latest`. This
keeps prerelease publishing from replacing a stable default installation.

```sh
pnpm version X.Y.Z --no-git-tag-version
```

Write `docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md` with relevant sections: New, Fixes, Breaking
changes, Migration, and Verification. Record native device/runtime evidence and
any unavailable checks. Do not claim a beta API was verified on hardware when
only a simulator was used.

## Verify the exact candidate

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run format:check
pnpm run lint
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run build
pnpm run docs:build
pnpm pack --pack-destination artifacts
node scripts/check-package.mjs artifacts/*.tgz
node scripts/check-release.mjs vX.Y.Z
```

Use an empty `artifacts/` directory for the candidate. `check-package` verifies
compiled JS/declarations, native sources, the podspec, README/license and package
identity, and rejects repository-only content and unresolved workspace ranges.
Inspect the tarball as well. Only this package's intended files should ship.

Run the native verification described in [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md) for
affected platforms. Verify old-SDK compilation and old-runtime fallback when SDK
guards change. Verify the RN example after dependency or codegen changes. Missing
native evidence is an explicit release limitation, not a passing check.

## Tag and publish

1. Commit the candidate version and notes. Submit the release PR and get review.
2. Merge after required CI passes. Wait for CI on the exact resulting `main`
   commit before tagging; a passing PR head is not the merge commit.
3. Create an immutable annotated tag and push it:

   ```sh
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m 'vX.Y.Z'
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. The Release workflow repeats CI, including native builds, for the tag. It
   refuses a tag/manifest mismatch, missing release notes or a commit outside
   `main`. It then waits for the `release` environment approval when that
   protection is configured. Give the approver the direct Actions run URL.
5. Approve the release after reviewing the checks. The job builds and packs with
   pnpm, validates the tarball, and publishes that tarball with npm provenance.
6. Verify the version and dist-tag in the run and registry:

   ```sh
   npm view react-native-reserved-regions@X.Y.Z version dist.integrity --json
   npm view react-native-reserved-regions dist-tags --json
   ```

7. Create a GitHub release using the committed notes:

   ```sh
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --title vX.Y.Z --notes-file docs/releases/X.Y.Z.md
   ```

   Add `--prerelease` for a prerelease version. Keep the package manifest at the
   released version until the next release preparation.

## Recovery

- Authentication failure: verify the exact owner, repo, workflow filename and
  environment in npm's trusted-publisher settings. Do not add a long-lived token
  as a workaround. Complete any account approval in npm directly.
- Failed checks: fix and verify on `main`, then prepare a new immutable version
  and tag. Never move a pushed release tag.
- Interrupted publish: first query the exact registry version. The workflow skips
  an already-existing version and verifies its dist-tag. It refuses registry
  lookup errors other than E404 before publishing.
- A newer release has moved the dist-tag: do not rerun an old release to move it
  backwards. Verify the older version separately and preserve the newer tag.
- A release cannot be overwritten on npm. Fix the code and publish a new version.

Setting up this workflow does not publish a version. Pushing a release tag is
a separate release action.
